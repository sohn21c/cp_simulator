## Objective  
This project is to build RVIZ simulator that would display robot model of a patient wearing 5 IMU sensors. Completed simulator can read IMU sensor readings(acceleration and angular velocity) in .tsv format, perform proper dead-reckoning and visualize position and orientation of five sensors in 3-d space.
